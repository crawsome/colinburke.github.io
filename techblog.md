## üí° Development Philosophy

### Learning Through Building

Every project teaches something new. My approach:

1. **Start with a problem** - Real needs drive better solutions
2. **Prototype quickly** - Get something working, then iterate
3. **Document learnings** - Knowledge sharing benefits everyone
4. **Open source when possible** - Community improvement

### Edge Case Expertise

I'm an "edge-case person" who encounters unusual problems. This perspective helps me:
- Build more robust error handling
- Consider unusual use cases
- Create tools for niche problems that others haven't solved
