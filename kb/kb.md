# Knowlege Base

## Purpose
Every day I solve problems. Here I document them.

## The information available here
You won't find average info here. These are solutions and cautious advice for 

I'm an edge-case person, who falls into the cracks, and has experienced the lesser-treaded paths of life. 

The phenomenon of irregularity is too consistent, so I need to start writing down what can be predicted. 


### Projects

* [Refurbing an old arcade machine]()


### Tech
* [Replacing a degraded drive on ZFS]()


### Body, diet, exercise
* [Living with IBS-C]()

* [Stress can destroy you]()

* [Your internal judge is a culmination of all your past critics]()

* [Being highly sensitive is a double-edged sword, know how to swing it]()

* [Breathing matters so much]()

* [Yoga is imperative for desk hobbyists]()

* [Other awesome uses for Nail clippers]()

* [Exfoliate between your toes!]()

* [Getting rid of stuff in your ears]()


### Home, living, basic human upkeep

* [I gave up on drawers, and now use IKEA Kallax]()

* [Sticky hooks are everywhere in my home]()


### Finance, risks
#### Day trading
* It's just not worth it. No page needed for that one. 


### Manners / Career
[Humility]()
* **How you Act** category
* Be humble! If you walk into a company like a hotshot, nobody will like you. 
* "I'm not overqualified for anything" - Story
* Expect someone to explain something to you as if you don't know it. Surprise them later if you can't get an opportunity to tell them what you know. Let them talk!
* Teaching is something experienced people usually like to do, but often don't have someone to teach. Don't take the "Teachers" on your team for granted. Attend some of their meetings. Even if you don't learn a single thing, you participated, and people will remember your interest. 
* If someone asks you to tell them how much you know about something, tell the truth, but I am a little humble about it. 

#### "On a Scale of 1-10 how well do you know..."
There's only one or two topics I'll say I know 10/10, personally. Computer Troubleshooting and Customer support for me, personally. 

* 10/10 is overconfidence to me, unless you're a contributor/certified expert in the technology with years of work.
* 9/10, in my opinion, is the best response, and claims they are an expert in a subject. 
* 8/10 shows confidence in the subject, and knows there's more to learn. 7/10 shows hesitation, but willingness to work, 6/10 and lower, don't even write it. 
* Don't expect a thank you for something that's a given. 
* Don't place your self value on other's recognition. Recognize yourself. 

[Patience]()
* **How you Act** category
* Wait your turn to talk. 
* Apologize if you accidentally interrupt. 
* At a stalemate, insist only once or it becomes awkward. 

[Tact]
* Know that you can walk a tightrope of tact, or walk a wide path of candidness. 
* I greatly respect those with enough tact to keep their mouth shut until they have something imporant to say. 
* I'm intrigued by 

[Hesitation]


Don't cut them off and say "I already know this", because you might become subject to their frusturation, and a test.


### Travel, Cars
[Watch perpendicular stoplights, too!]
