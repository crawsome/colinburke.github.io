Verse 1
C
Arms around the world
F
Wanting to be seen
        Am
Through all the words and prose
                F
We're all just easily deceived

C
Fear is old and worked
   G
We walk each other home
Am7
Time may occupy your minds but
  F
Still we are alone

Fall in love with greed, just watch the ego tear apart

Cause out beyond the sky

Time may occupy us but we're only who we are
