The Dear hunter: Mr Malum off of "The Color Spectrum"

Standard tuning no capo. Key of E minor.

Good luck with those diminished chords, or just flat the 5th on a power chord and be lazy. Listen to the song to get a feel of the dims.

Original tabbers had issues with chords that shared common notes, mislabeling an Am as a C, etc

I tried my lot at correcting the lyrics, chords placement, and chord structure.

If you hear a mistake, please correct! I did my best!

VERSE 1
    Em            Em           Edim  Em C   Em   Edim Em
Mr. Malum's got a sec--ret, he keeps on giv-ing  spee-ches.

       Em          Em                F#dim
Just a whisperinng pre--cision, that cuts through hesitation.

       G              C               B
With a sharp and able wit to keep the dogs at bay.


PRE-CHORUS
         Am     B           Em                G
When the truth arrives, you wont believe your eyes.

     Am               G         Am              B7
He's triumph's pess-i-mist, but he's no less content.


CHORUS
         G             Am
With the wo-rld in the grip of his hands,

                Em              Cm
He'll crush the air out of it's lungs. 

             G           Am
Say we don't want him to have it all,

             Em               C
But now it's just too late to ask,

            D                  B
Because his hold has turned so tight.


VERSE 2
    Em             Edim Em      Edim  Em C    Em  Edim  Em
His puppets to the left and his pawns to line the right,

          Em               Edim Em     F#dim
But every eye is front and cen--ter, a cruel intoxication,

         G                 C                 B
From the sap that trickles down his branches to their mouths.


PRE-CHORUS
         Am      B          Em                G
When the truth arrives, you wont believe your eyes.


  Am      G             Am           B
A vicious champion, but he's no less content.

CHORUS
         G             Am
With the wo-rld in the grip of his hands,

                Em              Cm
He'll crush the air out of it's lungs. 

              G           Am
Say we don't want him to have it all,

             Em                C
But now it's just too late to ask,

            D                  B
Because his hold has turned so tight.

BRIDGE
    Em                                  C
The air we're barely breathings not enough,

                D                      B7
And this final gasp that rattles us to bed,

         Em                             C
The last thing that we will see, is Mr. Malum.

            G
Tighten his tie,

                     C
When he slips on his suit, 

          G
A link to cuff,

                       Cm
And the shine of his shoes.

              D                                   B
But when the truth arrived, you didn't trust your eyes.


SOLO/CHORUS: (notice it's just a broken up chorus)
G       Am

Em      Cm

CHORUS (part)
              G           Am
Say we don't want him to have it all,

             Em                C
But now it's just too late to ask,

OUTRO
             G                       C
You had your chance, but you turned away again.

             G                       C
You had your chance, but you turned away again.

             G                           Cm         Cm6
You had your chance, but you turned your eyes away again.   

(Fade out on last chord)
