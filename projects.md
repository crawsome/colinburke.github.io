# My Projects

* Do you have a pile of PDFs that need to be renamed to something inside each PDF? Check out my [PDF Renamer](https://github.com/crawsome/pdf-renamer)
* I created a [text-based RPG](https://github.com/crawsome/PyRPG_Mini) in Python. Fork it and you can customize CSVs for levels, enemy names, weapons names and power, and create your own turn based RPG!
* I created a [guitar scale chart in Python](https://github.com/crawsome/GuitarScaleChart), so you can practice your scales.
* I'm a lifelong gamer. I want to finish making [my 2D dream game](https://imgur.com/a/1XQ0gmU)
* I'm into [random music generation](https://github.com/crawsome/PyMusicGen)
* I like Jeopardy, so I made a [trainer for it](https://github.com/crawsome/jeopardy-trainer)
* I like Riddles, so I compiled a [large CSV of them](https://github.com/crawsome/PyRPG_Mini/blob/master/csv/riddles.csv)
* I want you to be a [good speller](https://github.com/crawsome/spellingpractice)
* Do you wear a Fitbit Versa? Check out my [free custom Megaman Watch Face](https://github.com/crawsome/BurkeClock)
