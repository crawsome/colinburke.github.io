*"Filled with determination"* - Developer bringing ideas to life through learning and experimentation.

## üöÄ What Drives Me

I'm a curious developer who falls into the cracks and experiences the lesser-traveled paths of technology. This gives me unique insight into solving unusual problems and building tools others haven't thought of.

Currently exploring multiple domains:

- **Music Technology:** Web-based music generation and audio processing tools
- **Web Applications:** Flask-based utilities and image management systems
- **Developer Tools:** Productivity apps and automation scripts
